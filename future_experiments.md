## Future experiments, explorations and questions to answer

* What's the effect of jet lag?
* How good is the home advantage?
* Does empty net work?
* What proportion of my opponent's score did each player provide? (The real value of the player) - DONE
* How does being on the power play benefit a player's scoring rates?
* If everyone had played everyone, what would the scores be? - DONE
* Can we model each person and each stat as a random variable? Then simulate? - ATTEMPTED
* Can we give a value to each category to describe how beneficial it is for a match up? If it's really close then it's beneficial. if I'm winning by a lot or they are, it's not as worth it. 
* How good is each team really doing? Taking into account games played, and against whom.
* Vs just the playoff teams, how is each team doing?
